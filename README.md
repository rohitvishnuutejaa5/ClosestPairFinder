# Closest Pair Finder (Java)

This project implements two classic algorithms to solve the **Closest Pair of Points** problem in 2D space:

- **Brute Force** (O(nÂ²))
- **Divide and Conquer** (O(n log n))

It compares their empirical and predicted runtimes and visualizes the results through charts and data tables.


## Files Included
- `src/ClosestPairFinder.java`: Main program file.
- `outputs/output1.txt`, `output2.txt`: Sample result outputs.
